## Motivations

It is a pain when building your own resume, especially when you wanted to use this to secure a job! However, different HR has different style and requirement. With the help from the industry panels in Malaysia, I came to conclusion that it's still the best to "back-to-basic". Graphic-intensive resume is great, but are you sure that the graphic is always an add points to your resume? This resume will be dedicated for fresh graduates, especially engineering students!
